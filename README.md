# Scavenger-Hunt
Capstone Project

Scavenger Hunt App is an iOS application which modernizes classical scavenger hunt games. We wanted to make scavenger hunts easier to set up and play while simultaneously adhering to its roots of being interactive and communicative. In other words, our app makes it easier for players to play and creators to create scavenger hunts. This app incorporates many technological features/systems such as QR codes, scanning, messaging, an authentication system, and even a leaderboard system. This app was developed with Xcode using the Swift programming language while also utilizing Firebase for the backend. It is our hope that this app simplifies scavenger hunts and provides fun/enjoyable experiences to our users.
